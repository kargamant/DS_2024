# DS_2024
This repository is dedicated to mephi data science course that I'm passing in 2024.

>unfortunately, I'm not allowed to publish here materials from nvidia course, because I respect intellectual laws of the USA as well as laws of any other country.
>But if you really want to look at some, email me, I'll see what I can do.
